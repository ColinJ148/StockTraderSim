# Stock Trader Simulator
<h3>
 Introduction
 </h>


The whole purpose of this project is to allow people who don't know much about the stock market
and allowing them to learn about it without risking there hard earned money. It can be intimidating 
for someone to put a part of their income into something they really don't understand. This "paper trading" 
account lets them see whats its like to invest their "money" and watch it grow.


<h3>
 
 
 GUI Design
 </h>

The design is tailored to user with less experience in the stock market so I chose to just have the 
prices and changes of prices displayed a long with the company name and their ticker symbol. I didn't
 want to use fancy charts or anything of that nature because it can become very overwhelming to a new trader
 I used big red text whenever the user tried to do something that wasn't possible like trying to buy more stocks
and are unable to because a lack of cash in the account.
